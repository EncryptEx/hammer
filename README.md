A discord.py bot - #DISCORD HACK WEEK 2019

100% Python

For what is used for Hammer? (Use /hammer in a discord guild/server) Hammer is a moderation Bot, which has lots of functional commands, from the basically (warn, kick or ban) to advanced functions like automod, with about 880 blocked swear words. Also is 99.7% uptime. **#DiscordHackWeek Creation**


What and how many commands has Hammer? (User /help in a discord guild/server and check DM.) [Or scroll down](https://github.com/limusina10/hammer#useful-comands)
# Add the bot
https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=591633652493058068&permissions=8&scope=bot


Or you can create yours:

# Starting your bot
Clone and enter repo folder
```sh
git clone https://github.com/EncryptEx/hammer && cd hammer
```
Crete virtual enviroment
```sh
python -m venv env && source env/bin/activate
```
Install dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the bot
```sh
chmod +x ./bot.py && python ./bot.py
```

I do poersonally recommend to use a bot hosting service to handle the bot, I suggest to use a vps and the ``screen`` command to run it in background.
